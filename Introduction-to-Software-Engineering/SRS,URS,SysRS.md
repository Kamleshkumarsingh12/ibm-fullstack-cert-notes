# Software Requirements Documents: SRS, URS, and SySRS

## ðŸ“‘ Overview
Three key documents in software development define requirements at different levels:

| Document | Full Form | Purpose | Audience |
|----------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **URS**  | **User Requirements Specification** | High-level needs from the user's perspective. | Business stakeholders, clients. |
| **SRS**  | **Software Requirements Specification** | Detailed functional & non-functional requirements for developers. | Developers, testers, project managers. |
| **SySRS** | **System Requirements Specification** | Technical specs for hardware/software environment. | System architects, DevOps teams. |

---

## 1. **User Requirements Specification (URS)**  
- **Focus**: "What" the system should do (business goals).  
- **Contents**:  
  - User stories/use cases.  
  - Business processes affected.  
  - Compliance/regulatory needs.  
- **Example**:  
  > *"The system must allow users to reset passwords via email."*  

---

## 2. **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**  
- **Focus**: "How" the system will meet URS (technical details).  
- **Contents**:  
  - Functional requirements (features).  
  - Non-functional requirements (performance, security).  
  - Data flow diagrams, APIs.  
- **Example**:  
  > *"The system shall encrypt passwords using AES-256 before storage."*  

---

## 3. **System Requirements Specification (SySRS)**  
- **Focus**: Infrastructure needed to support the software.  
- **Contents**:  
  - Hardware/OS requirements.  
  - Network bandwidth, scalability.  
  - Third-party dependencies.  
- **Example**:  
  > *"The application requires Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with 8GB RAM."*

## ðŸ”‘ Key Differences  
| Aspect       | URS          | SRS          | SySRS        |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Level**    | Business     | Functional   | Technical    |
| **Detail**   | High-level   | Detailed     | Hardware-focused |
| **Owners**   | Clients      | Developers   | System Admins |

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Always trace requirements from **URS â†’ SRS â†’ SySRS** to ensure alignment with user needs and technical feasibility.
