# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Phases

The **SDLC** is a structured process for developing high-quality software. Below are its key phases:

## ðŸ”¹ Phases

1. **Planning**  
   - Define project scope, goals, timelines, and resources.  
   - Risk assessment and feasibility study.  

2. **Requirements Analysis**  
   - Gather and document functional & non-functional requirements.  
   - Stakeholder collaboration (SRS document).  

3. **Design**  
   - System architecture (high-level & low-level design).  
   - UI/UX mockups, database design, and tech stack selection.  

4. **Development (Coding)**  
   - Write code following design specifications.  
   - Version control (e.g., Git) and code reviews.  

5. **Testing**  
   - Unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing (UAT).  
   - Bug fixing and performance optimization.  

6. **Deployment**  
   - Release to production (manual or CI/CD pipelines).  
   - Environment setup and monitoring.  

7. **Maintenance**  
   - Bug fixes, patches, and feature updates.  
   - Performance tuning and scalability improvements.  

## ðŸ”§ Popular SDLC Models  
- **Waterfall** (Sequential)  
- **Agile** (Iterative, Scrum/Kanban)  
- **DevOps** (Continuous Integration/Deployment)  

> Each phase ensures alignment with stakeholder needs, cost efficiency, and software reliability.

ðŸ“Œ **Pro Tip**: Use tools like Jira (planning), Figma (design), GitHub (development), and Jenkins (CI/CD) to streamline SDLC workflows.
