# Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

## Overview
**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** is a cloud computing model that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.  
Instead of buying and managing physical hardware, organizations can rent servers, storage, and networking from cloud providers on a **pay-as-you-go** basis.

## Key Features of IaaS

- **On-Demand Resources** – Quickly provision or scale computing power, storage, and networking.  
- **Cost Efficiency** – Pay only for the resources you use, reducing upfront hardware investments.  
- **Scalability** – Easily adjust resources based on workload demand.  
- **Accessibility** – Access infrastructure globally via the internet.  
- **Managed Infrastructure** – Providers handle physical servers, data centers, and maintenance.

## Common IaaS Services

- **Compute** – Virtual machines, containers, GPU-based instances  
- **Storage** – Block storage, object storage, file systems  
- **Networking** – Virtual networks, load balancers, firewalls  
- **Security** – Identity and access management, monitoring tools

## Advantages of IaaS

- Reduces capital expenditure (CAPEX)  
- Provides high availability and disaster recovery options  
- Offers flexibility to run any workload or operating system  
- Speeds up deployment of applications and services

## Examples of IaaS Providers

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2**  
- **Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines**  
- **Google Cloud Compute Engine (GCE)**  
- **IBM Cloud Virtual Servers**  

---

## Use Cases

- Hosting websites and web applications  
- Running development and testing environments  
- High-performance computing and big data analytics  
- Backup and disaster recovery solutions

## Summary
IaaS provides the foundational layer of cloud computing by delivering **virtualized infrastructure on demand**.  
It helps organizations reduce costs, scale quickly, and focus more on their applications rather than managing physical hardware.
