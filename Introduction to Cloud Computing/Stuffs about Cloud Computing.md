# Cloud Adoption Learnings

In this module, I explored how cloud technologies enable organizations of all sizes to:

- Stay agile and competitive  
- Drive innovation  
- Deliver unique customer experiences  

Today, the key question for businesses is not *if* they should move to the cloud, but *what strategy* they should follow to adopt it effectively.
