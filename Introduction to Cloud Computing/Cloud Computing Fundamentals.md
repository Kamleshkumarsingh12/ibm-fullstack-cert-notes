## Part 1: Cloud Storage Types and Content Delivery Networks

### Four Main Types of Cloud Storage

#### 1. Direct Attached Storage (Local Storage)
- **Definition**: Storage presented directly to a cloud-based server
- **Location**: Either within the host server chassis or within the same rack
- **Characteristics**: Closest physical proximity to the server

#### 2. File Storage
- **Access Method**: Presented to compute nodes as a Network File System (NFS)
- **Connection**: Connected to compute nodes over standard ethernet network
- **Use Case**: Suitable for shared file access across multiple systems

#### 3. Block Storage
- **Connection**: Presented to compute nodes using high-speed fiber connections
- **Provisioning**: Typically provisioned in volumes
- **Mounting**: Volumes are mounted onto compute nodes
- **Performance**: High-speed access due to fiber connections

#### 4. Object Storage
- **Access Method**: Accessed via an API
- **Independence**: Doesn't require an underlying compute node
- **Capacity**: Offers infinite capacity - pay only for what you use
- **Performance**: Slowest read and write speeds compared to other storage types
- **Scalability**: Can continuously add files with usage-based pricing

### Storage Type Comparison
The four storage types differ in several key areas:
- **Access methods**: How they can be accessed
- **Capacity**: Storage limits and scalability
- **Cost**: Pricing models and cost structures
- **Data suitability**: Types of data they're best suited to store
- **Performance**: Read-write speed capabilities

### Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- **Definition**: A distributed server network that accelerates internet content delivery
- **Functionality**: Delivers temporarily stored or cached copies of website or media content
- **Location-based**: Content is delivered to users based on their geographic location
- **Purpose**: Improves content delivery speed and user experience

## Part 2: Cloud Computing Strategies and Architectures

### Hybrid Multi-Cloud Strategy
A cloud adoption strategy that enables seamless interoperation between public clouds, private clouds, and on-premises IT infrastructure. This approach allows organizations to leverage the best cloud-based services from different public cloud providers while maintaining flexibility and avoiding vendor lock-in.

### Microservices Architecture
An application development approach where applications are built as a collection of loosely coupled and independently deployable components or services. This architecture pattern offers several advantages:
- **Efficient Development**: Teams can work on different services independently
- **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain individual components
- **Upgrades**: Services can be updated independently without affecting the entire application
- **Scalability**: Individual services can be scaled based on demand

### Serverless Computing
A computing approach that offloads common infrastructure management tasks to cloud providers, allowing developers to focus on core development activities:
- **Infrastructure Management**: Cloud providers handle provisioning, maintaining, and scaling compute resources
- **Developer Focus**: Developers can concentrate on development and testing
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for actual compute time used
- **Scalability**: Automatic scaling based on demand

### Cloud Native Applications
Applications specifically built or refactored to operate optimally in cloud environments:
- **Development Methodology**: Built using DevOps methodologies
- **Architecture**: Consist of microservices packaged in containers
- **Portability**: Can run in any environment
- **Agility**: Enable quick iterative cycles for creating and updating features
- **Scalability**: Designed to take full advantage of cloud capabilities

### DevOps Methodology
A collaborative approach that bridges development and operations teams to enable continuous software delivery:
- **Collaboration**: Enables seamless cooperation between development and operations teams
- **Continuous Delivery**: Supports quick iterative cycles for software delivery
- **Efficiency**: Reduces overhead, duplication, and rework
- **Cloud Integration**: Tools, practices, and processes help manage cloud complexities
- **Reliability**: Enables quick and reliable solution delivery and updates

### Application Modernization
A strategic approach that helps organizations transform their existing applications to take advantage of modern technologies and cloud capabilities:
- **Digital Transformation**: Accelerates organizational digital transformation initiatives
- **Technology Adoption**: Enables leveraging of new technologies and services
- **Market Responsiveness**: Increases organizational agility to respond to changing market dynamics
- **Cloud Enablement**: Cloud computing serves as a key enabler for application modernization
- **Competitive Advantage**: Helps organizations stay competitive in rapidly evolving markets
